							This website was created solely for the Web-Development lecture led by Prof. Heuzeroth of HdM Stuttgart.<br>
							My Alias on this Website is <em>Ton Ngoc That</em> and I humbly consider myself the <strong>Site Admin</strong>.<br>
						</p>
						<p style="margin-right: 220px">
							Though sparsely filled, I do feel proud to have created such a fantastic fansite for my beloved music circle and I dearly hope that the visitors will feel the same.
							I sincerely believe that the capabilities of doujin-created music far precede the reputation of those performing music circles.<br>
							My dearest wish is to give them the attention they deserve as to open said music to the public audience.
						</p>
						<p>
							You too can do your part in order to make this kind of music more accessible to everyone!<br>
							Spread the word!
