# demetori-fansite.github.io
I once created a potential fansite for the doujin circle "Demetori" in order to learn HTML and CSS.

Feel free to use [this link](https://lochergit.github.io/demetori-fansite.github.io/) in order to access the website mockup.

Due to the fact that the website was not maintained since its creation in 2017,<br>
the content found on the website mockup may be heavily outdated.
