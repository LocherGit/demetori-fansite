				"<i>Bless you, Demetori, for bringing us closer to the very definition
				of quality heavy metal instrumental arranges that stems
				from the timeless finesse of Touhou's musical scores.</i>"<br>
				Site Admin
			</p>
			<p>
				The longrunning yet obscure video game franchise titled <strong>Touhou</strong> and the similarly obscure metal circle <strong>Demetori</strong> have a fruitful relationship<br>
				as Demetori's members do not write their own music but base all their composition off the musical scores that the japanese video game has to offer.<br>
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Demetori</strong> is a band comprised of only two brothers: <em>Kyuhouji</em> (Alias of: Tadashi Teramae) and <em>Tokunan</em> (Alias of: Masaru Teramae).<br>
				The band was formed in 2005 and it works exclusively within the "Touhou Project" arrange genre, <br>
				The line-up consists of Kyuhouji playing the drums and Tokunan working with the guitar, bass and keyboard.<br>
				meaning that it only arranges music themes found within the game and releases full-length cover albums of this so-called "Touhou Metal".<br>
			</p>
			<p>
				In essence, Demetori is considered to be a progressive / powermetal band but it also delves a bit into the genre of symphonic metal.<br>
				Due to the fact that the band only has two members, Demetori makes use of guest players during live concerts and gigs.
			</p>
			<p>
				Even if it isn't the first band to act purely as a music band offering arranges, Demetori peaks high above the others with its smashing guitar riffs,<br>
				technical proweness and mesmerizing musical interpretations of the video game's themes,<br>
				resulting in timeless arrangements that brings not only new fans to the game series but also fans to the metal genre.<br>
